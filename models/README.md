The original ESRGAN models are included here:

1. `RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth`: the final ESRGAN model used in [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219). 
2. `RRDB_PSNR_x4.pth`: the PSNR-oriented model with **high PSNR performance**.

As well as the fine tuned models
3. `RDB_ESRGAN_remote_finetune.pth` the ESRGAN model finetuned with remote sensing images
4. `RDB_ESRGAN_vid_finetune4.pth` the ESRGAN model finetuned with videos
